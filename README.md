# Convince

## Problem Description

Back in September 2020, I enrolled in [Beginner Flutter course](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/159) from Dicoding. And on the last part of the course, I got a submission task to create a Flutter app. There are some requirements, such as:
- Stateless widget usage
- Stateful widget usage
- Have a minimum of 2 pages and using Navigation
- No overflow within the app (plus point if it has responsive design)

And since Covid situation is getting worse in Indonesia, I thought creating an app to shows live data from Covid status in Indonesia will be helpful. That's why Convince is created in the first place.
